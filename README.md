# Sorting_Algoritm_using_Java
sorting Algorithm using java programming language.
<br>
Bubble Sort:-
======================
* compare adjacent element and check if they are in correct order or not . if they are not in correct in order then swap them.
* Time complexity of the sorting algorithm is in worst case will be o(n^2) and in best case may be o(n).
* it is a stable algorithm i.e it maintains the same order if there are multiple time same element present.
* In this algorithm we don't use extra space then so the space complexity of the algorithm will be o(n).
* It is also  an inplace algorithm that it don't use any extra copy .

Selection Sort:-
==============================
* it traverse the whole array and compares which element satisfy the required condition and then it uses swapping technique to swap the selected element with the other element at the right position.
* Time complexity is o(n^2) in all the conditions.
* Auxilary space complexity is o(1) but it may take extra space so the overall space complexity will be o(n).
* it is not a stable sorting algorithm though it does not maintain the same order if there is duplicate in the array.
* it is an inplace algorithm that we don't create any extra copy.

Insertion Sort:-
==================================
*in this algorithm it takes an element and iterate over the whole sorted array and find the coorect position of the element and insert it there.
*Time complexity in worst condition is o(n^2) and in average condition 0(n^2). But in best condition the time complexity is omega(n).
*it is a stable algorithm though maintain the same order after sorting if there is duplicate elements in the array.
