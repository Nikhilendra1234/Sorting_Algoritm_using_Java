# Sorting_Algoritm_using_Java
sorting Algorithm using java programming language.
Bubble Sort:-
======================
* compare adjacent element and check if they are in correct order or not . if they are not in correct in order then swap them.
* Time complexity of the sorting algorithm is in worst case will be o(n^2) and in best case may be o(n).
* it is a stable algorithm i.e it maintains the same order if there are multiple time same element present.
* In this algorithm we don't use extra space then so the space complexity of the algorithm will be o(n).
* It is also  an inplace algorithm that it don't use any extra copy .
